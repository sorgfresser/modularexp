# Setup

I used poetry for the dependencies. To install the dependencies, run
```bash
poetry install
```

To add a dependency, run 
```bash
poetry add <dependencyname>
```
e.g.
```bash
poetry add transformers
```

# Usage

You can find some tests for the fast modular exponentiation function in tests.
The actual implementation of the dataset is found in modularexp/data, yielding a datasets dataset.
